# Adversarial MNIST Image Generation

We generate adversarial "6" digit images from real "2" digit images. A sample of adversarial "6" digit images, along with their corresponding "2" digit images, and their differences are provided [here](https://github.com/rhseqlhs/adversarial_MNIST/blob/master/Image_Table.png).
